# Problem 6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

The solution doesn't use any data structures except for Python's built in list passed in as the input.
The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)` as we iterate over the list once, and within the loop compare if the current element is greater than or less than the current max or min.
The space complexity of the solution is `O(1)` because the space required does not grow depending on the size of input `n`.
