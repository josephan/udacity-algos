# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

The data structure used in this problem is Python's built in list which is the solution's input.
The solution of this problem iterates over the input list only once so the time complexity is `O(n)`.
The solution also swaps elements in the array in place and doesn't create any other arrays so the space complexity is `O(1)`
