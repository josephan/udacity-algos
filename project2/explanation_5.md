The lookup time for a single block is `O(n)` because we need to traverse the list to look for a block.
The insert time for a single block is `O(1)` because blocks are always added to the head.
The space complexity for this blockchain is `O(n)` because the amount of space it takes is dependent on the input size (number of blocks created).
